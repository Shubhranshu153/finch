# PR Update Required

Your changes look good technically, but the PR title needs to be updated to follow the conventional commit format. Please update the PR title to start with one of the following types:

```

```

Available types:
- feat
- fix
- docs
- style
- refactor
- perf
- test
- build
- ci
- chore
- revert
- exp

This PR should use "fix" since it fixes a bug with permissions in the devcontainer functionality.
